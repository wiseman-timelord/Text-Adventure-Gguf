<br># Stable-RPG
<br>AI powered role-playing game
<br>
<br>
<br>The game:
<br>The user will choose from set locations: house, street, park, woods, pub, lake, car, van, realistic and logical, locations.
<br>In each location, there will be a random set of AI roleplayers present from these choices: gang, police, friends, strangers.
<br>The user produces, actions and speech, in relevance to the, environment or AI roleplayers, the AI must respond in, actions and speech.
<br>After response from AI, the AI summarize, user and AI, actions and speech, result in a loop of, user input, AI response, AI summary.
<br>The game will end, when the user decides to, end the game and exit, otherwise the roleplay could go on forever.
<br>the locations chosen by the user, the user are able to travel, resulting in, shuffle of roleplayers and change of prompts.
<br>
<br>
<br>The plan:
<br>-Create fleshed out scripts from framework already created by GPT4 + VoxScript Plugin, using upto date information from internet.
<br>-Try to get it to work on StableLM, just because this would be both the word Stable in the name, maybe train a new one if I have to..
<br>-Integrate interface, it will be curses to start with then more graphical later for Stable Diffusion Integration from local models.
<br>-Improve memory functions, fur StableLM there will be 4096 context length, this would be good for a 1-2k token memory of events.
<br>-Integrade Sable Diffusion 1.5 output to generate representation of, user and AI, actions as multiple characters in a scene.
