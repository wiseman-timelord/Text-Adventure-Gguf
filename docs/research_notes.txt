RESEARCH SHORTLIST..
1. Text-based RPGs: Games using text characters instead of graphics. Examples include MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons). This is the core concept of our Stable-RPG project.
2. Role-playing: Text-based roleplay involves creating a character and interacting with other characters in a text-based setting. This is a key feature of Stable-RPG.
3. AI in games: AI contributes to the behaviors and intelligence of characters in video games. Stable-RPG leverages AI for dynamic dialogues and scenarios.
4. ChatGPT in games: ChatGPT can be used in game development to create dynamic dialogues. Stable-RPG uses a similar model, StableLM, for text generation.
5. TUI using curses: The curses library in Python is used to create text user interfaces. Stable-RPG uses windows-curses for its text-based interface.
6. JSON best practices: JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format. Stable-RPG uses JSON to manage game state.
7. Game loop in text RPG: A game loop is a loop within a video game where the game's events are processed. Stable-RPG has a similar loop for user input, AI response, and AI summary.
8. StableLM: StableLM is a language model developed by OpenAI. Stable-RPG uses StableLM for text generation.
9. Python import statements: Import statements in Python are used to gain access to the code in another module. This is a fundamental part of Python programming used in Stable-RPG.
10. Python virtual environments: Virtual environments allow you to create isolated Python environments where you can install packages without interfering with the global Python installation. This is a good practice for managing project dependencies.
11. PyPI: PyPI (Python Package Index) is the official third-party software repository for Python. Stable-RPG's dependencies can be installed from PyPI.
